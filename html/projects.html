                    <p>
                        The Opal+ app was NSW Transport's take on digitalizing its infrastructure. The core idea of the
                        Opal+ app was passengers paying a set amount of time for different access tiers within an
                        ecosystem of transport services, which was being expanded to include point-to-point options
                        like e-bikes and rideshare services under a holistic transit system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The application went under a trial period, which was not successful, and thus the project was
                        terminated. I joined the TNSW development team from the start, and during my time, I was heavily
                        engaged in all aspects of the project, from backend to mobile application development.

                        The SaferJourneys App, combined with the SaferJourneys Tag, used the sensors embedded in the

                    <h2>Exhibition Catalogue App</h2>

                    <p>
                        Exhibitions are places where people meet and greet, but because of the vast number of catalogues,
                        brochures, and business cards that people receive, it sometimes becomes overwhelming to manage
                        all of them. The Xhibition App was a product to help exhibition participants communicate in an
                        organized manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform provided capabilities to share product information and digital catalogues with
                        participants, and more importantly, to also share contact information and digital business cards
                        in an organized manner, so that participants could follow up on their meetings after the
                        exhibition as well. I was one of the owners of this product and thus I was involved in all aspects
                        of the development from concept design up to deployment and marketing.

                        "Museums are places of knowledge, and the more information that can be provided to museum-goers,
                        the better their experience. The idea with this product was to provide a digital platform for
                        visitors to consume digital information such as video, audio, images, or even AR/VR content
                        about items in a museum in an interactive way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform consisted of an application that identified museum items via an associated QR code,
                        communicated with backend servers to fetch information related to the item, and then present it to
                        the visitor. As one of the product owners, I was engaged from conceptual design of the platform
                        up to deployment and marketing.

                    <p>
                        SAHAB is a healthcare asset management suite based on RFID technology. By tagging expensive
                        hospital assets and monitoring them, hospital managers would get full insight into the distribution
                        of the assets throughout the hospital, and also into the usage and availability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RFID readers were scattered and installed around the premises to detect the assets, and handheld
                        RFID readers would also be used by asset managers to perform daily routines. SAHAB is the web-based
                        system that glues all of these units together and provides insight and reports to the management team.

                    <p>
                        Training robotic agents through AI/ML requires a lot of training data, and training data is hard
                        to create, tag, and refine. So, in one word, preparation of data is hard and time-consuming.
                        When I joined the Center of Autonomous Systems (CAS) at UTS as a robotic engineer, we had the
                        vision to reduce this critical time, and the idea was to use synthetic images for training and,
                        secondly, to transfer part of the trained AI/ML network to a new agent so that experiences could
                        be re-used. I experienced working with ROS and Gazebo and made use of computer vision techniques
                        in conjunction with AI/ML while working on this project.

                        the main product owner, I worked on a product named 'Roll Stand' that simulated the roll movement
                        of a flying vehicle such as a quadcopter.

                        Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) flying vehicles are a type of flying vehicle that have the
                        advantage of not requiring much space during takeoff and landing. The most famous flying vehicle
                        using this concept is the F35 fighter plane series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I joined a team of engineers with the idea of deploying this concept to drones so that such
                        vehicles could be used in places where space is limited and also are hard to reach for people.
                        Using such devices in missions such as rescue operations after a disaster can be very advantageous
                        since the terrain that rescuers need to operate on is unknown and could be very dangerous.

                        through the use of NFC-based tags and readers. As a product owner and a computer hardware engineer,
