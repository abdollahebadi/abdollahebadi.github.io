            <h2> Get to know me...!</h2>
            <p id="intro-text">
                Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer 12 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies,
                consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business
                and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my skills.

                Since 2007, I started my journey as an engineer. Despite my personal preference, I found myself studying
                Computer Engineering, which I have to say I did not connect with initially. But things took another turn
                when I started to code X86 assembly. All of a sudden, I felt a click, and from then onwards, I spent day
                and night learning how to MOV variables from one register to another. I even wrote a snake and ladder
                game in Assembly.

                I've always had a passion for mechanical engineering, and thus I decided to major in an interdisciplinary
                field such as robotics to not only learn about the mechanics of life but also make use of the software/hardware
                knowledge that I had learned.

                Fast-forward to this date, and I can see the benefit of this decision. It has helped me work
                in a variety of fields and collaborate with awesome entities. Below, you can see some of the well-known
                companies and entities that I have collaborated with, and after that, you can get to know some of the
                skills I have obtained in the past years as well.

                                I have always had a thing for mobile devices and the fact that people have such an immense
                                capability in the tip of their hands, so I have put a lot of effort into finding out what
                                can I do to unleash such a power for the benefit of the people.
